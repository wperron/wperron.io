# My Reading List

There is so much information and content being generated on the web nowadays,
and so many interesting books, talks and papers being published that it's
hard to keep track of everything that is going on. I recently realized that it
was becoming increasingly hard for me to remember everything I had read, and
remember where the hell had I read about some concept or idea.

So I decided to start keeping a reading list; a distillation of all my readings
in the last month (maybe I'll change the time scale in the future, who knows).
I'm also limiting myself to 20 elements per month. The idea is to reflect on
the various blog posts, articles or books that I read and publish a list of
those that had the most lasting impact on, the ones I resonated the most
strongly with.

So here it is, my personal reading list:
