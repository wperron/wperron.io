Hi! I'm a software engineer currently living in Montr√©al, Canada üçÅ.
I'm particularly interested in building highly-available, highly-distributed
systems and anything cloud-related. I'm a firm believer in the DevOps
movement and the Lean principles. During my (admitedly short) career,
I've had to opportunity to lead multiple interesting projects, ranging from
migrating from svn to Git, slowly rewriting legacy applications with more modern
and resilient technology and infrastructure, and have been at the forefront
of company-wide shift from waterfall to agile and DevOps methodologies.

I also play guitar in my spare time and have two lovely cats (which I will
most _definitely_ tell you all about if you ever meet me in person).
