Hi! I'm a software engineer currently living in Montr√©al, Canada üçÅ.
I'm particularly interested in building highly-available, highly-distributed
systems and anything cloud-related. Right Now I'm working with [Deno](https://deno.land/),
focusing mostly on the [Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) serverless platform.

I also play guitar in my spare time and have two lovely cats (which I will
most _definitely_ tell you all about if you ever meet me in person).
