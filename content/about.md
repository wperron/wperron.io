Hi! I'm a software engineer currently living in Montréal, Canada 🍁. I'm
particularly interested in building highly-available, highly-distributed systems
and anything cloud-related. I'm currently working at Shopify on distributed
tracing systems.

I also play guitar in my spare time and have two lovely cats (which I will most
_definitely_ tell you all about if you ever meet me in person).
