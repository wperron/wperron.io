Hi! I'm a software engineer currently living in Montréal, Canada 🍁.
I'm particularly interested in building highly-available, highly-distributed
systems and anything cloud-related. Right Now I'm looking for new opporunities!
If you have an opening be sure to check my résumé and don't hesitate to contact
me.

I also play guitar in my spare time and have two lovely cats (which I will
most _definitely_ tell you all about if you ever meet me in person).
