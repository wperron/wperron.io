title: What Logging Wisdom Leaves Out
---

I often see posts about logging. From tips and tricks, to "best practices", it
seems like there's plenty of wisdom on the subject going around. Logging has
become a mature part of software engineerin. And while there's varying advice
out there, it feels like we've reached a point of shared wisdom on the topic
that is relatively uniform across the industry.

[insert something about looking at logging in isolation here].
