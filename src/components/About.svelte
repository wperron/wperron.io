<div id='about'>
	<p>Hi! I'm a software engineer currently living in Montr√©al, Canada üçÅ.
	I'm particularly interested in building highly-available, highly-distributed
	systems and anything cloud-related. I'm a firm believer in the DevOps
	movement and the Lean principles. During my (admitedly short) career,
	I've had to opportunity to lead multiple interesting projects, ranging from
	migrating from svn to Git, slowly rewriting legacy applications with more modern
	and resilient technology and infrastructure, and have been at the forefront
	of company-wide shift from waterfall to agile and DevOps methodologies.</p>
	<p>I also play guitar in my spare time and have two lovely cats (which I will
	most <i>definitely</i> tell you all about if you ever meet me in person).</p>
